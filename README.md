# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview: #
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we had to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
